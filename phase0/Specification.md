## Specification

Our program is dedicated to provide a service for students to discuss course content, for faculty to post about course and program information, and for professors to post and delete comments. All three types of users should go through the registration process to access this program. Students will need their student id, and if already known, names of program enrolled and names of courses enrolled. Faculty and professors will need their staff id.

Students who enrolled in the same courses can post to the current course discussion board, reply to othersâ€™ comments and delete their own comments. They also have access to the past post pages to learn from past students who previously enrolled in the course. They can also see other courses taught by their professors to learn about them.

Inside the course page, students can see course name, course information, professor information, current discussion board and the discussion boards in the past three semesters. Professor and faculty can see the same course page, with faculty being able to update course information. Faculty can create and update course pages. For professors, they have the right to delete comments and reply to the comments.
