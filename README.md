## Utalk

Our group want to make an online discussion forum based on course for students, professors and faculties in the University of Toronto. 

Important: our program needs version 17 JDK to run, also setting language level to 17.

Basic function include: 

Student: add comment, delete one's own comment, enroll course, drop course, present course page, present postpage 

Faculty: add course, update course

Professor: add comment, delete comment, enroll course, drop course, present course page, present postpage 

Please set the absolute path in the file everytime you pull the main to your own computer. (Will be using relative path or set up configurations to resolve this in the future). 

There is a branch for our past document just for storage.
